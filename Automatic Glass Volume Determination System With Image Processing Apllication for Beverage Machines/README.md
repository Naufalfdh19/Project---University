# Project Summary: Automatic Glass Volume Determination System
The "Automatic Glass Volume Determination System With Image Processing Application for Beverage Machines" project aims to develop an automated solution for accurately determining the volume of a glass in beverage machines using image processing techniques.

## Key Features:
- Image Capture: Utilizes cameras or sensors to capture images of the glass and its contents.
- Image Processing: Applies computer vision algorithms to analyze the images and extract relevant data.
- Volume Calculation: Calculates the height of the glass and determine the size or volume of the glass that you are already set.
- Accuracy Enhancement: Implements techniques to enhance accuracy, such as edge detection and color analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- Python for image processing algorithms and logic.
- OpenCV for image capture, preprocessing, and analysis.
- Using cvzone library for object recognition and height calculation.
- Arduino Uno to integrated python algorithm with hardware.
- Servo motor to rotate the tap.
