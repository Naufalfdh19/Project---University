# Project Summary: Automatic Door Lock Using Face Recognition
This project focuses on implementing a smart and secure automatic door lock system using face recognition technology. The aim is to create a seamless and convenient access control solution that enhances security and user experience but still use an artificial house.

## Key Features:
- Face Detection: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize human faces.
- Face Recognition: Use cvzone library to recognize some face using just some picture.
- Access Control: Automatically unlocks the door for recognized faces while denying access to unauthorized individuals and the door will close automatically after the door is closely enough about 3 second.
- Artificial house: Build to implement face recognition algorith for automatic door.

## Technologies Used:
- OpenCV and Dlib for computer vision and face detection.
- Use python library called cvzone for face recognition models.
- For camera still use a computer camera.

## Goals:
Enhance security by replacing traditional locks with a robust face recognition system.
Improve user convenience and accessibility through automated door unlocking.
Provide a customizable and scalable solution for various access control scenarios.
